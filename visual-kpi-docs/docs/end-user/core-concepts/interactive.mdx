Transpara's Visual KPI is designed to help organizations monitor, analyze, and present their key performance indicators in a visual and interactive format. Visual KPI offers a user-friendly interface that displays essential metrics, data trends, and performance insights through various visual elements such as groups, dashboards, charts, tables, and trends.

Visual representations such as graphs, charts, and dashboards simplify complex data sets, making it easier for users to interpret and understand trends within the data. Interactive visuals enable stakeholders to identify areas requiring attention or improvement, facilitating faster and more accurate decision-making processes.

You can customize and personalize dashboards according to your or other users' preferences and requirements. Additionally, Visual KPI provides collaborative features, enabling teams to share insights, collaborate on data analysis, and collectively work towards common goals.
