Dashboards offer a personalized overview of your core information. Customize multiple dashboards to monitor the processes you manage efficiently. You can customize your dashboards with several Visual KPI objects like KPIs, charts, tables, groups, trends, and external links. In addition, it's possible to easily arrange, resize, and incorporate custom images, statistics, and dynamic text blocks.

## Selecting a Dashboard

To change between different dashboards, use the **Dashboard** (<SvgFont icon="10"/>) pull-down menu to see the existing dashboards associated with the profile you are currently using. You can create new dashboards in that menu using the **New Dashboard** option.

  alt="Dropdown menu"
/>

You can have as many dashboards as you want, linked to one or more profiles. When you change your profile, the dashboard list updates, presenting the dashboards linked with the current Dashboard.

## How to create a Dashboard 

You can create a new dashboard from scratch or copy an existing one. For instance, copying an existing dashboard can be helpful when you want to edit a locked dashboard or compile dashboards from different profiles in your profile. To create a new dashboard, follow the steps below:

1. Open the **Dashboard**(<SvgFont icon="10"/>) pull-down menu.
2. Select **New Dashboard**.
3. Type a dashboard name and description.
4. If you want to copy an existing dashboard, check the **Copy Existing Dashboard** option. Use the pull-down menu to choose the existing dashboard you wish to copy.
5. Click **Save**.

You'll be automatically redirected to the new dashboard page.

## Options menu

In the Dashboard, the Options menu (<SvgFont icon="188"/>) offers different ways to interact with Visual KPI depending on what you are viewing, the configuration of your Dashboard, and whether it's locked or unlocked by the administrator. Here are the possible available options on the Dashboard Tab:

1. **Customize Dashboard** (<SvgFont icon="260"/>): Allows you to customize your Dashboard or create a new one, assuming you aren't using a locked profile.

2. **New Dashboard** (<SvgFont icon="10"/>): It's an alternative way to create a new dashboard.

3. **Ad Hoc Trend** (<SvgFont icon="165"/>): Create an Ad Hoc Trend, a custom type of trend that you can build inside your Visual KPI site and add to your Dashboard.

4. **Pin to Bookmark Bar** (<SvgFont icon="120"/>): You can pin almost anything in Visual KPI to the bookmark bar, such as a KPI, chart, table, or external links. When you choose this option, Visual KPI creates a shortcut to the page you're accessing at that moment. Use the pins at the top to navigate to important pages quickly.

5. **Hide Bookmark Bar** (<SvgFont icon="109"/>): Use this option to hide the Bookmark Bar.

6. **Show Dark/Light Theme** (<SvgFont icon="68"/> or <SvgFont icon="80"/>): Switch between Dark and Light Themes.

7. **View in Server/Client Time** (<SvgFont icon="52"/>): Change the displayed times and dates between Server and Client Time.

## Customize a Dashboard

In addition to creating Dashboards based on existing models, you can arrange your Dashboard to suit your needs by:

- Resizing and moving KPIs.
- Selecting different KPIs' visualization.
- Adding new objects.
- Defining custom time ranges.

:::info Access to the Dashboard Customization

The **Customize Dashboard** (<SvgFont icon="260"/>) option is only available in the **Dashboards** tab.

:::

:::note Save your changes

After customizing the dashboard, click **Save** at the bottom of the panel or the green checkmark (<SvgFont icon="190"/>) at the top to save your customizations. Otherwise, you'll lose your changes.

:::

### Resize and move objects

The option to resize and move KPIs and other objects enables you to place the KPIs you use often or need to see immediately at the top of the screen and make KPIs larger or smaller in size.

To resize or move KPIs in your Dashboard, follow the steps described below:

1. Click **Options**(<SvgFont icon="188"/>) on the top right.
2. Select **Customize Dashboard** (<SvgFont icon="260"/>).
3. On the **Customize Your Dashboard** screen, you find blocks representing the existing KPIs and other objects from the current Dashboard.
    - **Move**: To move an object, drag and drop it into place. As you move the object around the Dashboard, other objects will move over to make room.
    - **Resize**: To resize an object, you have some options:
      - Drag right or left to make the object wider or narrower.
      - Drag up or down to make the object taller or shorter.
      - Drag the lower-right corner to change both dimensions at the same time.
4. After customizing the objects as you wish, click **Save** at the bottom of the screen or click on the green checkmark at the top (<SvgFont icon="190"/>).

You can see a configuration example in the GIF below.

:::info KPIs and other Object sizes

KPIs and other objects vary in size based on their type.
- Geo Maps and KPI lists must be at least 1/2 of the width of your Dashboard (up to full width).
- Charts, trends, texts, or image widgets can be as small as 1/4 of the Dashboard width.
- KPI dashboard widgets can range from 1/4 to 1/2 of the width. The same applies to height.
- Some Dashboard objects can expand to 8 times (8x) the original height.

:::

### Select an object visualization 

Some Visual KPI objects have multiple possible visualizations and information that can be displayed directly on the Dashboard. You can select the visualization and information you want to see on your Dashboard through the Dashboard customization page. To change the visualization option, follow the steps below:

1. Click **Options**(<SvgFont icon="188"/>) on the top right.
2. Select **Customize Dashboard** (<SvgFont icon="260"/>).
3. Select the object block for which you want to change the visualization in the **Customize Your Dashboard** page. A green dashed border appears around the selected object, and a new board listing all available visualization options will appear.
4. Check the visualization option you want to see in the Dashboard for the selected object. Depending on the object type, different options will be available. The complete list is presented below:
    - Sparkline
    - Bullet Chart
    - Status History Chart
    - Statistics 
    - Actions
5. Click **Apply**.

:::info Not Saved Changes

If you change a visualization or information selection and don't click **Apply**, a red border will appear around the object to show that your changes were not saved.

:::

### Add new objects to your Dashboard

You can add any object to your Dashboard or even use an object, such as a KPI, to create a new dashboard with just that object. To add a new object to an existing or new Dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Access the KPI, object, or any visualization you want to add to the Dashboard.
2. Click **Options**(<SvgFont icon="188"/>) on the top right.
3. Select one of the three options available:
   - **Add to *Dashboard*** (<SvgFont icon="115"/>): The current dashboard name will be in the *Dashboard* place. This option adds the current view directly to the Dashboard you're currently using.
   - **Add to New Dashboard** (<SvgFont icon="115"/>): This enables you to use the current visualization in a new dashboard. If you choose this option, you'll need to provide the new dashboard name and description, which will contain only the selected object. However, you can add new objects in the future.
   - **Add to Existing Dashboard** (<SvgFont icon="115"/>): Use this option to add the current visualization to another dashboard other than the one you are currently using.

:::tip Add to New Dashboard

Consider creating a new dashboard when making a data story or analyzing a project. With this approach, you can easily share the insights. As you continue the analyses, you can add new objects to the dashboard, enabling you to build a complete snapshot of the analysis task.

:::

The current object will be available on the selected Dashboard. You can use the [resize and move objects](dashboards#resize-and-move-objects) to position them in the desired place.

### Customize the Time Range 

Each KPI has a different standard Time Range for presenting data. However, to perform some analysis, it's important to have all objects using the same Time Range to examine cause and effect, for example.

To define a standard Time Range for all objects in your Dashboard, follow the steps below:

1. Click on the Time Range Picker (<SvgFont icon="244"/>).
2. Select a default or custom Time Range.

All data related to time will be displayed on your Dashboard based on the selected range. Use the time range paddles to advance or regress the time range. For example, if you selected a 24-hour time range, the advance paddle will show KPI data for the following 24-hour period.

  alt="Dashboard time range"
/>

:::info Some objects aren't based on Time Ranges

Some objects, such as Geo Maps, don't have an associated Time Range. They only present the current value. Therefore, no changes occur in those objects when you change the Time Range.
