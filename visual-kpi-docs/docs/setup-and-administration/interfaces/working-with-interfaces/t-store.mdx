## Configuration

The Template interface can receive up to four parameter, with only the first one being required. The four parameters are described below:

- **Metric**: The value which needs to be recovered.
- **Filter** (Optional): Conditions applied to the data source to selectively include or exclude specific elements. You can add multiple filters, separating them with commas.
- **AggregationFunction** (Optional): Operation applied to a set of values or data points to produce a single, summarized result. The available options for this are:
    - [ raw, avg, sum, count, min, max, range, stddev, median, twavg ]
- **AggregationBucket** (Optional): Grouping of data points based on certain criteria.

### Lookup format

To use these parameters as lookups you will need to separe them with pipes, as presented below:

```
Metric|Filter|AggregationFunction|AggregationBucket
```

Below you find examples of use:

#### Metric only

To get `wavelength` as metric use:
```
wavelength
```

#### Adding a filter to lookup

To add a filter or multiple filters to the lookup, use:
```
wavelength|asset=sn1051_kalkallo,fiber=1,sensor=1
```
Where filters are equal to `asset=sn1051_kalkallo,fiber=1,sensor=1`.

#### Using all parameters

To add AggregationFunction and AggregationBucket to the lookup you would use this:
```
wavelength|asset=sn1051_kalkallo,fiber=1,sensor=1|avg|5 mins
```
Where:
- AggregationFunction = `avg`
- AggregationBucket = `5 mins`

#### Skipping a parameter

You may need to add AggregationFunction and AggregationBucket but without any filters. To do this you need to leave the space between the two pipes empty, like:

```
wavelength||avg|5 mins
```
