Visual KPI RCS can integrate with both AF databases, or any SQL data source. For each integration type there are specific configurations that need to be done. While AF configurations mostly happens on their side of the integration, SQL will require you to configure a few queries, as Visual KPI will need to know what attributes to look for.

## Installing Visual KPI RCS

Visual KPI Server Manager has installation setups for a few different data sources, such as:

<IconCards info={
  [
    {
      name: 'AF',
      logo: 'osisoft'
    },
    {
      name: 'inmation',
      logo: 'inmation'
    },
    {
      name: 'SQL',
      logo: 'odbc'
    },
    {
      name: 'VMware',
      logo: 'vmware'
    },
    {
      name: 'Xompass',
      logo: 'xompass'
    },
    {
      name: 'Zabbix',
      logo: 'zabbix'
    },
    
  ]
}/>

To install a new RCS in your Visual KPI instance, you need to follow the steps below:

1. Right-click **Remote Context Service** in the left panel.
2. Go to **Install New Visual KPI Remote Context Service**.
3. Select the RCS you want to install, from the options listed above.
4. Follow the installation wizard, entering the necessary information.

This process is presented below:

## Configuration

Configuration for all available RCS, except for SQL, will be completed on the data source side. Please refer to the link below:

<LinkCards data={
  [
    {
      name: 'AF Databases',
      linkTo: '/docs/setup-and-administration/automation/rcs-with-af-databases'
    }
  ]
}/>

When creating a SQL RCS, you must generate specific metric queries and add them in Visual KPI Server Manager, also configuring parameters in Visual KPI Designer. To learn how to configure SQL RCSs, refer to the link below:

<LinkCards data={
  [
    {
      name: 'SQL Databases',
      linkTo: '/docs/setup-and-administration/automation/rcs-with-sql-databases'
    },
  ]
}/>
