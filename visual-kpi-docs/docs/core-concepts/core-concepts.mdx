In this section, you can learn the essential ideas to become a pro at using Visual KPI. These concepts lay the groundwork for a better understanding of the software, making it easier to get started.

## Main concepts 

- **[KPI (Key Performance Indicators)](./core-concepts/kpi)**: KPIs are crucial metrics to measure the performance of critical activities. They represent specific data points or indicators indispensable for tracking and evaluating how well an organization is meeting its goals. KPIs are essential tools for decision-makers, providing insights into performance trends and guiding strategic adjustments based on real-time data. 

- **[Hierarchy/Groups](./core-concepts/hierarchy)**: In Visual KPI, hierarchy and groups act like organized folders. They contain KPIs, Charts, and Tables. Hierarchy is like a smart way to categorize your data. It automatically shows data in different colors to indicate its status. You can easily see what percentage of KPIs are in different states. Groups summarize the status of everything inside them, no matter how many there are. 

- **[Design and authoring](./core-concepts/design)**: This part of Visual KPI involves configuring key objects like Groups, KPIs, Charts, and Tables. Visual KPI Designer, an Excel-based tool, is versatile and suitable for tasks ranging from prototypes to large-scale systems. The KPI design process covers Basics, User Experience, SPC, Extended, and Access Group List sections. Administrators manage links for user accessibility, ensuring vital resources are easily reachable.

- **[Data Sources](./core-concepts/data-sources)**: In Visual KPI, "Data Sources" refer to the locations and origins of data that the system accesses and utilizes for various functions. Understanding data sources is crucial as it ensures the practicality and feasibility of requested interfaces. Moreover, a data source serves as the point from which the software collects and integrates data. This knowledge is essential for effectively integrating data into the Visual KPI system. 


-  **[Interfaces](./core-concepts/interfaces)**:  Interfaces in Visual KPI are how the software retrieves data from external systems. These interfaces are always read-only, meaning they can fetch data but not alter it. Users can ensure smooth data flow into the KPI system by selecting the right interface, enhancing functionality, and providing accurate information for informed decision-making.

-  **[Access Levels](./core-concepts/access-level)**: Access levels in the context of KPI systems refer to the permissions and restrictions applied to users or roles within the system. Access levels determine what users can see and do within the KPI system, ensuring data security and integrity, efficiency, usability, and compliance.
