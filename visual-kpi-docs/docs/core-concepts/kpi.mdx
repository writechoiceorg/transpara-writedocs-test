KPI stands for **Key Performance Indicator**, a measurable value organizations use to evaluate their success in achieving specific business objectives. Simply put, it refers to something you consider important enough to monitor that should behave as expected. These KPIs, such as Key Metrics and Performance Indicators, are closely related to performance analysis. Each KPI is associated with specific data used to evaluate and measure various metrics that provide insights into multiple aspects of business performance.

## How KPIs work on Visual KPI.

Visual KPI works by visually representing these KPIs in an easily understandable and accessible format. It collects data from diverse sources such as databases, applications, or other systems and then displays the information through intuitive visualizations like charts, graphs, or dashboards. 

Furthermore, KPIs are often color-coded to signify their status on Visual KPI, making it easy for users to quickly assess performance against expected standards.

These indicators serve as a core element of the user experience, providing visual and meaningful insights into an organization's performance. Visual KPI is an assertive tool for organizations that provides a comprehensive and visually engaging representation of key metrics based on near real-time data.
