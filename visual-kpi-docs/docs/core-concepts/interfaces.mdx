Visual KPI Interfaces serve as essential tools for fetching data from external systems. These interfaces are designed for read-only purposes, allowing End Users to retrieve data without the ability to modify it. Admins must only make this process once, unless the data source changes, and must choose the appropriate Interface type to meet their specific data access requirements.

## Purpose of interfaces

The primary goal of Interfaces is to adapt data from various sources and standardize it for use within the Visual KPI server. External data may come with different configurations or organization from that used by Visual KPI, requiring preparation to shape the data into a uniform collection. After an Administrator sets up an Interface, this data preparation occurs in real-time when the Visual KPI server receives updated information, ensuring that the external data is seamlessly translated for use by Visual KPI and presented to End Users.

## Interface outputs

An Interface should provide three fundamental data structures to ensure Visual KPI functions properly:

- **Current Value**: Enables retrieval of the current KPI value.
- **Trend Data**: Users can retrieve a series of trend KPI values between two timestamps.
- **Historical Value**: Provides access to historical data at a specific time or before a given time.

## Interface components

To make data available, an Interface needs to be built with three main components:

- **Connection to the Data Source**: Establishes a connection to the external data source.
- **Query System**: Reads requests and prepares received data for use within Visual KPI.
- **Security Systems**: Ensures authentication and prevents data leakage.

## Integration process
The process to set up and use an Interface involves the following steps:

1. Define the KPI, such as reactor temperature.
2. Specify the data source (Oracle Server, SQL, API, etc.) for the KPI.
3. Identify the specific data within the source that provides reactor temperature information.
4. Define the data querying method (SQL, API requests, etc.).
5. Perform data acquisition tests to standardize queries/requests.
6. Identify security and authentication actions required for data consumption.
7. Write the Interface code, a one-time process unless the data source is modified.

## Next Steps

Understanding Visual KPI Interfaces is crucial for understanding how data is captured and made available effectively. Refer to the [Interfaces](../setup-and-administration/interfaces) documentation for detailed guides on setting up Interfaces in Visual KPI.
