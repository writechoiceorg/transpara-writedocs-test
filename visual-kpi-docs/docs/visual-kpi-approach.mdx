When dealing with KPI data visualization, Transpara's Visual KPI stands out as a game-changer compared to other software. Visual KPI takes a different approach, providing automatic data visualization despite the type and origin of your data. This unique way of addressing the KPI data visualization sets it apart from other solutions, such as PowerBI.

## Why Visual KPI is Different From Other Solutions

Conventional data visualization software requires you to execute a time-consuming process to be able to visualize each KPI. For each KPI visualization, you need to create individual charts and link them to the data source. This repetitive process is unfeasible for companies with hundreds or thousands of KPIs to monitor. In addition, some data visualization tools are highly processing-demanding, presenting significant loading times and frequent slowing or even freezing devices.

### Visual KPI Advantages

Visual KPI is a data visualization tool that lets you focus on data analysis instead of creating charts. Once you connect to your data source, Visual KPI offers multiple out-of-the-box ways to visualize data that truly matters to your business. You can customize the visualization to meet your business's unique needs and switch between different visualizations as required.

Visual KPI has a lightweight interface that loads instantly on any device, eliminating the need to deal with long loading times or device freezing. It doesn't store your company's sensitive information and only acquires data from your data sources in real time.

In summary, the Visual KPI sets KPI apart from conventional data visualization tools by handling the data visualization and providing a light interface without storing data outside your server or cloud account.
