When managing a substantial volume of KPIs on your Visual KPI site, our search feature enables you to retrieve the information you need efficiently. In addition, it empowers you to create ad-hoc groups comprising KPIs that match your specified search criteria.

## Quickly find the status of a KPI using Visual KPI search

The Visual KPI search feature empowers you to search for any element within your Visual KPI site, whether it is dashboards, KPIs, groups, charts, or tables. When you start typing, results instantly appear below the search bar:

The Visual KPI search shows you the top 5 search results and their live status for each object type. If you click on an object type, you can see all results that match your search criteria:

If a KPI has a status, you will spot it in the search results. If you need a rapid status check on a KPI, type its name in the search bar, and the status will be right there in the results:

## How Visual KPI Search Functions

The Visual KPI search feature can find dashboards, groups, KPIs, charts, and tables for your specified search requirements. For example, when you search for 'region,' the results will prioritize dashboards, groups, and charts. On the other hand, when you search for 'CTG,' the initial results will highlight KPIs and charts.

In summary, the Visual KPI search feature will **find matches in various elements within the software**, including dashboards, groups, KPIs, charts, tables, and trends, based on the specified search criteria:

- **[Dashboard](./dashboard)**: name and description
- **[Group](./groups-hierarchy)**: name and description
- **[KPI](./kpi-trends)**: name, description, and Actual
- **[Chart](./charts)**: name and description
- **[Table](./tables)**: name and description
- **[Trend](./kpi-trends)**: pen names and pen lookups

## Use Visual KPI search to create ad hoc groups

You can also use Visual KPI's search feature to craft ad-hoc groups. When you search, all results are returned and categorized by object type. By clicking the top-level object, you'll see all KPIs that match your search parameter, effectively creating a group. To use this feature:

1. Search for parameters you require:

2. To view all KPIs matching your specified criteria and generate an ad hoc group, click on the highest-level object among the returned results:

This ad-hoc group provides all the tools and options available in any standard group. Access the [Group](./groups-hierarchy) page if you are unfamiliar with this functionality.
