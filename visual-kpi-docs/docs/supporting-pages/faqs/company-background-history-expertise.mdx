    <Accordion title="Why is Transpara the right company to be doing this? What is your background?">
      We've deep software and industrial backgrounds, with team members coming from the likes of Microsoft, OSIsoft, Honeywell, Accenture, and Aspen Tech. This is the third software company we've created, and we've a particular passion for productized solutions. With 500+ public releases under our belts, you get to benefit from all that rigor, even if you're not using Transpara in a hardcore, industrial environment.

      We're a small but highly active group of contrarians who've been building and releasing industrial-strength enterprise software products for decades. We've thousands of releases under our belts, hundreds of happy customers across more than 25 countries, and the battle scars to prove it.
