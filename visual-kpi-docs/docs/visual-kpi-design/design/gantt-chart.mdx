Gantt charts are a good way to track projects in Visual KPI. A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that can be used to show project schedules, dependencies and status. Configure Gantt charts using Visual KPI Designer.

Using a Gantt chart, you can show all of the elements of a project along a timeline, when each element is scheduled to be completed, any dependencies and the status of each. Task or project elements are listed along the vertical axis of the Gantt chart and the horizontal axis displays time intervals. Gantt charts are particularly useful in Visual KPI because you can display status.

## Define Gantt Chart Attributes

After you have created and configured some basic attributes for a chart, you can begin to design the “look” of the Gantt chart. Here, we show you the basic attributes that you need to set in order design a basic Gantt chart. To see all of the possible attributes you can configure, see [Charts Attributes & Keywords Reference Guide](/docs/visual-kpi-design/reference-tables/charts-reference).

You can also use queries and Connect Strings to connect to an SQL database.
