Want to display your Visual KPI data as a pie chart? It's easy to configure pie charts in Visual KPI Designer when you want a simple graphic that shows the relative proportions of your compared assets.

## Define Bar Chart Attributes

After you have created and configured some basic attributes for a chart, such as the chart name, description, groups and display order, you can begin to design the “look” of the chart. Here, we show you the basic attributes that you need to set in order design a basic pie chart. To see all of the possible attributes you can configure, see [Charts Attributes & Keywords Reference Guide](/docs/visual-kpi-design/reference-tables/charts-reference).

### Label & Color Pie Chart Slices

Start by naming each of the slices in your pie chart. You can have up to 20 slices of pie.

If you leave the slice color blank, Visual KPI will select colors, or you can customize the color of each slice of pie.

### Enter Values and/or Interface

To add data to your chart, you add a value, calculation and/or interface for each bar.
