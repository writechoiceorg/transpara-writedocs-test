Visual KPI Designer offers four distinct field types, each serving specific purposes:

- **Text**: Accepts alphanumeric characters.
- **Numbers**: Accepts integers exclusively.
- **List Selection**: Enables users to choose from predefined lists.
- **Automatically Assigned**.

Each field type has predefined limits:

- Text fields limit indicates the maximum character count allowed.
- List Selection is limited by the options available.
- Numbers and Automatically Assigned fields don't have limitations.

Below you find a table describing the limits of all group fields related to Groups.
