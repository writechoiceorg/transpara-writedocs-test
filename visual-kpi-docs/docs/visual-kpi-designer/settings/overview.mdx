The site settings feature within Visual KPI Designer empowers you to modify settings that impact your entire Visual KPI site. Any adjustments made here are applied sitewide.

When you click on the Site Settings icon (<PngFont name='options28' />), another toolset will open, enabling you to configure all sorts of things in your Visual KPI sites. Changes you make are immediately reflected in the Visual KPI site you're connected to while editing these configurations. End users accessing the site will see these modifications when data refreshes.

## Settings Hierarchy

Many settings you can change in each Object can also be set up in a Group or sitewide. The preference is always for the settings in that specific Object. If there is no Object setting, the preference goes to the Group. If there is no Group setting, the sitewide settings will be used.

### Settings Example

You set up the default range as one week. That means that, by default, all of your site's objects will show one week of data. However, there is one group in which you wish to show the data as three days by default. You can set that up in the group configurations, and if you do that, your site will show, by default, one week of information, but that group will show three days. And, if in that group you have one specific KPI you wish to see as one month by default, you can do that by changing that KPI's configuration.

:::tip Change as you Wish

Remember that the user can always change the range of any view. Setting a default is for the initial view when opening an object.
