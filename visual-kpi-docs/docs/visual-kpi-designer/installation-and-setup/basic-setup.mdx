When you start, visual KPI Designer is already set up with basic configuration. Setting your site's branding and finishing details takes only a few minutes. In addition, you can quickly add a few KPIs and have your website ready.

Visual KPI Designer allows you to control many configurations. This guide will help you create the basic configurations and explain the available features.

## Contextual help

In the Visual KPI Designer, each worksheet includes headers that indicate the data to be entered in a cell. Click in any header cell to see a tooltip explaining the data in that column.

In addition, some configuration worksheets have **Description** columns to add context to the current parameter. It tells you exactly what that item means and helps you know what kind of value to enter. For example, in the **Website Configuration** worksheet, the description for Site Title tells you that whatever you enter here will appear in the website's title bar.

## Website worksheet

On the Visual KPI Designer toolbar, you have access to site settings. To configure you site, select site settings (<PngFont name='options28' />) &#8594; **Features & Config** &#8594; **Website** which will open the **Website Configuration worksheet**. You can choose to keep any of the default settings, but here we will present some basic configurations you may want to set up immediately:

2. Enter your site's title.
3. Click the Save icon (<PngFont name='save28' />) in the Visual KPI Designer toolbar.
