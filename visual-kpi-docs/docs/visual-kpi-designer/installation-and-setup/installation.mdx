## Installation steps

Installing Visual KPI Designer, from start to finish, takes only three steps, and you can do it in about 5 minutes. 

:::note Close Microsoft Excel

The installation should work just fine with Excel open, but we recommend closing it first to reduce possible errors.

:::

To install the Visual KPI Designer, follow the steps below:

1. Access the [download page](https://www.transpara.com/software-downloads/) to get the latest Visual KPI Designer version. If you have a Transpara account, log in. Otherwise, create an account to access the download page.

:::info Older versions

If you're running an older version of Visual KPI Server, you need to find the corresponding Visual KPI Designer version. Access the [Release Archive](https://www.transpara.com/download-archive/) to see a complete list of all available Visual KPI Designer versions.

:::

2. Click the **Visual KPI Designer (.exe)** button to download the installer.

3. When the download is complete, run the **Visual-KPI-Designer-Setup.exe** installer. The file name may vary depending on the current software version.
4. Agree to the terms and conditions, and click **Install**.
5. When the installation is complete, click **Finish**.

Excel will open automatically after the installation process is completed. Visual KPI  Designer should now appear on the right side.

:::note Updating the Visual KPI Designer

If you're updating the Visual KPI Designer to a newer version, the steps are the same as the installation. As the new installation replaces the older version automatically, you don't need to uninstall it before updating. 

:::

:::tip When should you update the Designer?

The Visual KPI Designer should match your version of the Visual KPI Server. Therefore, you should update the Designer version when you update the Server software.
